                <p>We need your help to regain control of Shadow Moses, a 
                    secret nuclear weapons base off the coast of Alaska. 
                    Terrorists have taken over and seek to use the stockpile of 
                    nuclear weapons and a new mobile nuclear launch platform 
                    called Metal Gear REX to gain the remains of the legendary 
                    soldier, Big Boss.

                <p>
                    Enlist in the cause and change the world.
